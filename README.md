# Addition Scenarios Project

This repository contains an addition scenarios project developed during my training period. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to provide all possible addition combinations based on a number input from the user. As a beginner in JavaScript, I used this project to learn about basic logic-building in JavaScript, gaining valuable experience even though the initial logic has some errors and the app isn’t running as intended.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to take a user-inputted number and calculate all possible ways to represent it as a sum of smaller numbers. This exercise introduced me to JavaScript, helping me practice implementing logic, handling user input, and building interactive elements on a webpage. While the app is not currently functioning as expected due to logic errors, this project allowed me to develop essential skills and understand areas for improvement.
